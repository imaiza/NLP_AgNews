# NLP_AgNews_IñigoMaiza


Natural language processing project where I used Ag_News dataset to do some basic text mining, and to build some basic predictive models to classify the type of news (Business, Sports, Sci/Tech or World).

To reproduce the work, you just need to run the "NLP_IñigoMaiza.R" code, changing just two lines of code:
- Line 2: the "setwd()" function to the path of your working directory where your data is located.
- Line 17: set the "path_data" to the path where you want your dataset to be downloaded (use the same path as in Line 2).

In this repository you can also find a "Figures" file containing all the plots extracted from the code.
